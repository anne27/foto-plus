# foto-plus

## Getting Started

Has it ever occurred where you had to click your group photo bazillion number of times because every time someone manages to screw up his/her face? Well, we are working to provide a solution to that problem.

### Prerequisites

The code requires Python 2.7 and OpenCV version 3.2 to run.

### Usage

* Add 2 pictures by the names of `photo1.jpg` and `photo2.jpg` in the same folder as the code.
* Run `IA.py`.
* The blended photo is saved as `blendedpro.jpg` in the same folder.

### Examples

Initial images:

Result:

## Future Work

We are working towards a webapp for this code.
