# foto-plus

## Getting Started

Has it ever occurred where you had to click your group photo bazillion number of times because every time someone manages to screw up his/her face? Well, we are working to provide a solution to that problem.

### Prerequisites

The code requires Python 2.7 and OpenCV version 2.4.9 to run.

### Usage

* Add 2 pictures by the names of `photo1.jpg` and `photo2.jpg` in the same folder as the code.
* Run `IA.py`.
* The blended photo is saved as `blendedpro.jpg` in the same folder.

### Examples

Initial images:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anne27/foto-plus/master/test_images/photo1.jpg" alt="alt text" width="50%" height="50%">

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anne27/foto-plus/master/test_images/photo2.jpg" alt="alt text" width="50%" height="50%">

Result:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anne27/foto-plus/master/test_images/result.jpg" alt="alt text" width="50%" height="50%">

## Future Work

We are working towards a webapp for this code.
